# HBlink4: The next generation of HBlink
Intended to re-build from the ground up with several new capabilities that were not present in the orginal version or HBlink3.
* Per-endpoint registration, tracking and management. Abandoning the "system" concept.
* Private call routing based on last known endpoint of a radio ID.
* Inter-HBlink4 routing protocol for locating "interested" content endpoints.
* Improved information export for logging and visualizations
* Maybe a pony?

What it will not add:
* SQL database-based information storage
* Processing overhead that slows the call router -- pretty visualizations belong in other apps
* "Network" alignment/allegiances

Timeline:
* Not fast. My time for this is at an all time low, but maybe AI tools can help get it done faster!
