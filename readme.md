# HBlink4

HBlink4 is the next evolution of the HBlink DMR Server implementation using the HomeBrew protocol, developed by Cort Buffington, N0MJS. This version represents a complete architectural redesign reflecting a fundamental shift in how DMR networks operate. This version does not implement transit call-routing between DMR networks -- this is depreciated due to the ability for operators to make these choices by using DMRGateway in the MMDVM suite.

## Architectural Philosophy: From Transit Router to Endpoint Server

When I developed HBlink3, DMR networks required transit call routingâ€”servers had to relay traffic between networks, much like Internet autonomous systems. Repeaters could only connect to one server, so if you wanted access to multiple networks (KS-DMR, Brandmeister, DMR-MARC), your regional network had to act as a transit router, forwarding calls to and from other national or international networks.

The landscape changed dramatically with the development of **DMRGateway** by the MMDVM team. This software allows repeaters to split traffic by timeslot and talkgroup (TS/TGID tuples), connecting directly to multiple servers simultaneously. Repeaters can now reach different networks as primary sources, eliminating the need for transit routing.

**HBlink4 embraces this new paradigm.** Rather than implementing complex transit routing features, HBlink4 focuses on being an efficient **endpoint network server** with granular per-repeater control. This architectural shift enables:

- **Per-repeater routing rules** using TS/TGID tuples for precise call handling
- **Individual repeater management** rather than server-level "system" groupings
- **Direct source connectivity** without multi-hop relay complexity
- **Simplified architecture** focused on what modern networks actually need

HBlink4 will not implement transit call routing between DMR networks. The focus of HBlink has always been to enable smaller, regional neworks to operate with autonomy, and not be subject to rules, regulations, whims, desires and decrees pushed down by the "big network" operators. HBlink also no longer plays into the notion that a self-proclaimed authority should govern the issuance of endpoint IDs, TGIDs, etc. and as such will not implement subscriber ID aliasing from the central source. That's great for folks who want one big homogenous world-wide network -- but by and large, that assumes that everyone's purpose for using DMR is unfettered world-wide access to every other endpoint. I have no grudge against that, but I'm more interested in radio and repeaters. I am just not interested in creating a global VOIP network where hotspots are the primary target -- largely reducing the radio amatuer's use of radio to be, effectively, the same capabilities as a bluetooth wireless handset.

## Key Architectural Changes

- Elimination of peer mode - HBlink4 operates purely as a server
- Individual repeater management rather than server-level system management
- Direct repeater registration without binding to specific server instances
- Granular per-repeater control and monitoring
- **Tightly integrated web dashboard with modern look and feel** - Real-time monitoring with WebSocket updates, no page refreshes required

## Features

- **Native dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 support** - Simultaneous listening on both protocols for maximum compatibility
- Modern Python implementation with type hints
- Improved error handling and logging
- JSON-based configuration
- Enhanced repeater management
- Built on Twisted framework for reliable async operation
- **Tightly integrated web dashboard** - Real-time monitoring with modern look and feel (see [Dashboard Documentation](dashboard/README.md))
- **Stream tracking with immediate DMR terminator detection (~60ms)**
- **Real-time duration counter with 1-second updates**
- **Two-tier stream end detection (immediate terminator + timeout fallback)**
- **User routing cache for efficient private call routing**
- Pattern-based repeater configuration and blacklisting
- Per-slot transmission management

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HBlink4.git
cd HBlink4
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Copy the sample configuration file and modify it for your needs:
```bash
cp config/config_sample.json config/config.json
```

Edit the configuration file to set up your:
- **Global settings** - IPv4/IPv6 binding, timeouts, logging
- **Dashboard** - Event transport (Unix socket or TCP)
- **Blacklist rules** - Block unwanted repeaters
- **Repeater configurations** - Authentication and talkgroup routing
- **Talkgroup definitions** - Talkgroup names and bridging

For detailed configuration instructions, see the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md).

## Running

### Using systemd (recommended for production)

For production deployments, use the provided systemd service files to automatically start HBlink4 and the dashboard at boot:

```bash
# Copy service files to systemd directory
sudo cp hblink4.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp hblink4-dash.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Edit the service files to match your installation path
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/hblink4.service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/hblink4-dash.service

# Reload systemd, enable and start services
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable hblink4 hblink4-dash
sudo systemctl start hblink4 hblink4-dash

# Check status
sudo systemctl status hblink4
sudo systemctl status hblink4-dash
```

For detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting, see [SYSTEMD.md](SYSTEMD.md).

### Start all services (development)
```bash
./run_all.sh
```

This starts both HBlink4 and the web dashboard. Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8080

### Start services separately (development)
```bash
# Start HBlink4 server
python3 run.py

# In another terminal, start the dashboard
python3 run_dashboard.py
```

The server will listen for repeater registrations on the configured ports (default: 62031 for both IPv4 and IPv6).

For detailed dashboard features and configuration, see the [Dashboard Documentation](dashboard/README.md).
